## Abstract

European Engineering Learning Innovation and Science Alliance (EELISA) is the first alliance of Higher Education Institutions from different countries in Europe meant to define and implement a common model of European engineer rooted in society. This model envisages a series of recognitions (credential, supplement, degree) that students obtain when they participate in EELISA activities. This paper focuses on the EELISA credential which implies that EELISA activities have a social impact and this impact must be measured. Objective: This paper aims to determine whether methodologies exist to measure social impact in the field of engineering and whether they are applicable to the activities carried out in the context of EELISA. Specifically, it aims to answer the following research questions: i) What types of indicators are considered; ii) What methods/techniques are used; iii) What types of scales are used; and iv) What good/bad practices are described in the use of these methodologies?  Method: A Systematic Literature Review (secondary study) is conducted.  This review will be reported following the Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies (SEGRESS) guidelines. Results: The results of this work highlight the existing scarcity of methodologies to measure the social impact of engineering. In most cases, methodologies originating from the social or health sciences are used. Conclusions: It is necessary to define a methodology to measure the social impact generated in the engineering area and, more specifically, by the activities carried out in the context of EELISA. This work is a first step.
